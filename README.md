# Sales-Insight-

In this project we have tried to create a real life situation where we recieve data in form of SQL database.

What we have done is that we have loaded the SQL file to our PowerBI after configuring  MySQL connection.
I faced a few challenges there while doing this where the older version of the MySQL connection would do the work.

After loading the data we performed data cleaing and ETL. We used the option of Transform Data to do so.
In this process we removed the undesired data and learned to add new columns as per our need using the "Custom  Column" option as well.

After processing the data we made the Dashboard as per our need for the required data.
We made use of interactive Bar Charts, Pie Chart, Line Graph and Tiles which can be used as filters and other Power BI stuff to  make 
it look cool and interesting.

The file used as data is attaced.
